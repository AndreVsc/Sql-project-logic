# E-commerce Database Schema ðŸš€

**E-commerce DB** is a comprehensive relational database schema designed to power a modern e-commerce platform. It coordinates the entire sales lifecycleâ€”from product sourcing and inventory management to payment processing and final deliveryâ€”ensuring data integrity, scalability, and robust performance. The system is built around four core entities:

</p>

<br>

* **Clients**: Manages customer data with built-in support for both individual (`B2C`) and corporate (`B2B`) accounts.

* **Products**: A flexible product catalog that includes details on categories, pricing, ratings, and multi-location inventory.

* **Orders**: The transactional core of the system, linking customers to the products they purchase and tracking payment and shipping status from start to finish.

* **Suppliers & Sellers**: Manages the product supply chain, supporting both direct inventory from suppliers and a third-party marketplace model.

## **Key Features**

* **Robust Data Modeling**: Covers the complete e-commerce workflow, including inventory, multi-channel sales, and logistics.

* **Dual Customer Support**: Natively handles both individual and corporate clients, with unique `CHECK` constraints to ensure data integrity for different document types (CPF/CNPJ).

* **End-to-End Order Tracking**: Provides a clear view of an order's journey, from payment confirmation and processing to shipping status and final delivery code.

* **Complex Relationship Management**: Efficiently handles many-to-many relationships for order items, product suppliers, and inventory locations using clean join tables.

* **Analytics-Ready**: Structured to simplify data analysis and the generation of business intelligence reports on sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory turnover.

## **Database Architecture**

The schema is designed with a clear separation of concerns, ensuring a clean and maintainable data foundation for any application built on top of it.

* **Model Layer**: Contains the core business entities (Clients, Products, Orders) and their relationships, enforced through primary and foreign keys to guarantee referential integrity.

* **Integrity Layer**: Implements business rules directly at the database level using `CHECK` constraints, `UNIQUE` indexes, and `default` values to maintain high data consistency and accuracy.

* **Query Layer**: The relational structure is optimized for complex joins and aggregations, allowing for powerful and efficient data retrieval for application backends and analytics dashboards.

**E-commerce DB** is designed with scalability at its core, ready to be deployed for a small online store or a large-scale marketplace. The project prioritizes a clean data model and a maintainable architecture to ensure long-term reliability and ease of future expansion.
